# advent_of_code_2016
My Python solutions to http://adventofcode.com/2016

Yeah, there's only a few days.  It was my first AOC
and I was also trying to build CI systems for my
employer, so -- cut me some slack ok?

If you want to run these yourself, you'll need to set
some environment variables based on your AOC login.
These are expected by aoc_cookies.py:

AOC2016_GA and AOC2016_SESSION

You can find these in the cookie the AOC website
sends you when you are logged in.  Take a look at
your web request headers for any AOC web page.

I have them set as secrets on github to automate
running these them there.  Just a POC for Github
Actions/Workflows, really.
