# advent_of_code_2016
My Python solutions to http://adventofcode.com/2016

If you want to run these yourself, you'll need to create 
my_cookies.py which contains a single has with the cookies
that are set by the adventofcode web site.  This allows
the scripts to fetch the input data directly via http.

My file looks like this (but with real values not <hidden>):

cookies = {
    '_ga': '<hidden>',
    '_gat': '<hidden>',
    'session': '<hidden>'
    }
