# advent_of_code_2016
My Python solutions to http://adventofcode.com/2016

If you want to run these yourself, you'll need to set
some environment variables based on your AOC login.
These are expected by aoc_cookies.py:

AOC2016_GA
AOC2016_SESSION

You can see them by looking at the web headers for 
any AOC web page request (when you are signed in).
I have them set as secrets on github to automate
running them there.
